Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown
In the great green room.
There was a telephone.
And a red balloon,
And a picture ofThe,
cow jumping over the moon,
And there were three little bears sitting on chairs,
And two little kittens,
And a pair of mittens,
And a little toy house,
And a young mouse,
And a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush,
And a quiet old lady who was whispering “hush”,
Goodnight room,
Goodnight moon,
