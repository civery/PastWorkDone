Coping with changing requirements
·       System prototyping, where a version of the system or part of the system is developed quickly to check the customer’s requirements and the feasibility of design decisions. This approach supports change anticipation.
·       Incremental delivery, where system increments are delivered to the customer for comment and experimentation. This supports both change avoidance and change tolerance.
Software prototyping
·       A prototype is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options.
·       A prototype can be used in:
o   The requirements engineering process to help with requirements elicitation and validation;
o   In design processes to explore options and develop a UI design;
o    In the testing process to run back-to-back tests.
Benefits of prototyping
·       Improved system usability
·       A closer match users’ real needs
·       Improved design quality
·       Improved maintainability
·       Reduced development effort
