Software Processes
·       Specification – defining what the system should do;
·       Design and implementation – defining the organization of the system and implementing the system
·       Validation – checking that it does what the customer wants
·       Evolution – changing the system in response to changing customer needs.
Plan-driven and agile processes
·       Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
·       In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
·       In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches.
