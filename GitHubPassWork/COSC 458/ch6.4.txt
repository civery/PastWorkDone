Repository architecture
       Sub-systems must exchange data. This may be done in two ways:
o   Shared data is held in a central database or repository and may be accessed by all sub-systems;
o   Each sub-system maintains its own database and passes data explicitly to other sub-systems.
       When large amounts of data are to be shared, the repository model of sharing is most commonly used a this is an efficient data sharing mechanism.

Client-server architecture
       Distributed system model which shows how data and processing is distributed across a range of components.
o   Can be implemented on a single computer.
        Set of stand-alone servers which provide specific services such as printing, data management, etc.
        Set of clients which call on these services.
       Network which allows clients to access servers.
