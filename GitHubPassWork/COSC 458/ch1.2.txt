Software Engineering Ethics
·       Software engineering involves wider responsibilities than simply the application of technical skills.
·       Software engineers must behave in an honest and ethically responsible way if they are to be respected as professionals.
·       Ethical behaviour is more than simply upholding the law but involves following a set of principles that are morally correct.
