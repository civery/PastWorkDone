Requirements engineering processes
·       The processes used for RE vary widely depending on the application domain, the people involved and the organisation developing the requirements.
·       However, there are a number of generic activities common to all processes
o   Requirements elicitation;
o   Requirements analysis;
o   Requirements validation;
o   Requirements management.
·        In practice, RE is an iterative activity in which these processes are interleaved.
