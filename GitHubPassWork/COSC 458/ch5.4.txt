Behavioral models
·       Behavioral models are models of the dynamic behavior of a system as it is executing. They show what happens or what is supposed to happen when a system responds to a stimulus from its environment.
·       You can think of these stimuli as being of two types:
o   Data Some data arrives that has to be processed by the system.
o    Events Some event happens that triggers system processing. Events may have associated data, although this is not always the case.
