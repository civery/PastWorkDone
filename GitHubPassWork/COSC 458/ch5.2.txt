Interaction models
       Modeling user interaction is important as it helps to identify user requirements.
       Modeling system-to-system interaction highlights the communication problems that may arise.
        Modeling component interaction helps us understand if a proposed system structure is likely to deliver the required system performance and dependability.
       Use case diagrams and sequence diagrams may be used for interaction modeling.
