Architectural Design
       Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system.
       Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them.
       The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components

Advantages of explicit architecture
       Stakeholder communication
o   Architecture may be used as a focus of discussion by system stakeholders.
       System analysis
o   Means that analysis of whether the system can meet its nonfunctional requirements is possible.
       Large-scale reuse
o   The architecture may be reusable across a range of systems
o   Product-line architectures may be developed.

Architecture and system characteristics
       Performance
o   Localise critical operations and minimise communications. Use large rather than fine-grain components.
        Security
o   Use a layered architecture with critical assets in the inner layers.  Safety  Localise safety-critical features in a small number of subsystems.
       Availability
o    Include redundant components and mechanisms for fault tolerance.
       Maintainability
o   Use fine-grain, replaceable components.
