Class diagrams
       Class diagrams are used when developing an object oriented system model to show the classes in a system and the associations between these classes.
       An object class can be thought of as a general definition of one kind of system object.
       An association is a link between classes that indicates that there is some relationship between these classes.
       When you are developing models during the early stages of the software engineering process, objects represent something in the real world, such as a patient, a prescription, doctor, etc.

Data-driven modeling
       Many business systems are data-processing systems that are primarily driven by data. They are controlled by the data input to the system, with relatively little external event processing.
       Data-driven models show the sequence of actions involved in processing input data and generating an associated output.
        They are particularly useful during the analysis of requirements as they can be used to show end-to-end processing in a system.
