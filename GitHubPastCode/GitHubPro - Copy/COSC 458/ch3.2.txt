Refactoring
       Conventional wisdom in software engineering is to design for change. It is worth spending time and effort anticipating changes as this reduces costs later in the life cycle.
        XP, however, maintains that this is not worthwhile as changes cannot be reliably anticipated.
        Rather, it proposes constant code improvement (refactoring) to make changes easier when they have to be implemented.
Examples of refactoring
       Re-organization of a class hierarchy to remove duplicate code.
       Tidying up and renaming attributes and methods to make them easier to understand.
       The replacement of inline code with calls to methods that have been included in a program library.
Pair programming
       In pair programming, programmers sit together at the same computer to develop the software.
       Pairs are created dynamically so that all team members work with each other during the development process.
       The sharing of knowledge that happens during pair programming is very important as it reduces the overall risks to a project when team members leave.
       Pair programming is not necessarily inefficient and there is some evidence that suggests that a pair working together is more efficient than 2 programmers working separately.
