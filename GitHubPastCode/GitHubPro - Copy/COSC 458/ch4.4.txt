Requirements specification
        The process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document.
        User requirements have to be understandable by endusers and customers who do not have a technical background.
        System requirements are more detailed requirements and may include more technical information.
       The requirements may be part of a contract for the system development
o   It is therefore important that these are as complete as possible.
Ways of writing a system requirement specification

Guidelines for writing requirements
        Invent a standard format and use it for all requirements.
       Use language in a consistent way. Use shall for mandatory requirements, should for desirable requirements.
       Use text highlighting to identify key parts of the requirement.
       Avoid the use of computer jargon.
       Include an explanation (rationale) of why a requirement is necessary
Use Cases
        Use-cases are a kind of scenario that are included in the UML.
       Use cases identify the actors in an interaction and which describe the interaction itself.
       A set of use cases should describe all possible interactions with the system.
       High-level graphical model supplemented by more detailed tabular description (see Chapter 5).
        UML sequence diagrams may be used to add detail to use-cases by showing the sequence of event processing in the system.
