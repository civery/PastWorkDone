Requirements elicitation
       Software engineers work with a range of system stakeholders to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide, the required system performance, hardware constraints, other systems, etc.
        Stages include:
o    Requirements discovery,
o   Requirements classification and organization,
o   Requirements prioritization and negotiation,
o   Requirements specification.
Problems of requirement elicitation
        Stakeholders don뭪 know what they really want.
       Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms.
       Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements.
       Organisational and political factors may influence the system requirements.
        The requirements change during the analysis process. New stakeholders may emerge and the business environment may change
