o   Applications that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. These include web applications such as e-commerce applications.  
       Embedded control systems
o   These are software control systems that control and manage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded systems than any other type of system.
       Batch processing systems
o   These are business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs
       Entertainment systems
o   These are systems that are primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user.
       Systems for modeling and simulation
o   These are systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which include many, separate, interacting objects.
       Data collection systems
o   These are systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing.
       Systems of systems
o   These are systems that are composed of a number of other software systems
